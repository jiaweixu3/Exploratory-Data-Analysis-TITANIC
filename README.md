# üö¢ Project: Exploratory Data Analysis of Titanic Survival

## ‚ú® Summary

Successfully executed a complete exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of **668 passengers** to identify and quantify the key factors determining survival on the Titanic. This project involved data cleaning, feature engineering, and advanced visualization in R. The primary achievement was translating raw data into a clear analytical report, successfully identifying high-impact variables (like cabin access and wealth) and communicating these complex findings through data-driven narratives.

## üèÜ Core Achievements & Contributions

* **Quantified Survival Factors:** Conducted an in-depth analysis to answer key business questions, proving a strong correlation between social status and survival.
    * **Key Finding:** Quantified the impact of accommodations, revealing that passengers with a cabin had a **66.67% survival rate**, compared to only **33.33%** for those without.
* **Data-Driven Feature Engineering:** Preprocessed the dataset and created new, high-value variables to enable deeper analysis, such as `has_cabin` and `FamilySize`, which proved critical for the analysis.
* **Advanced Data Visualization:** Designed and implemented a suite of over 7 custom visualizations using `ggplot2` (including faceted boxplots, stacked bar charts, and jitter plots) to clearly communicate complex, multi-dimensional relationships.
* **Challenged Assumptions:** Uncovered counter-intuitive insights, demonstrating that:
    1.  Passengers traveling **alone** were often **wealthier** (paid higher fares) than those in large families.
    2.  Passengers traveling **alone** also had a **higher survival rate** than those traveling with family.
* **Comprehensive Reporting:** Authored a 5-page analytical report (`TITANIC_mont.pdf`) that presents the methodology, visualizations, and key conclusions in a professional, easy-to-understand format.
